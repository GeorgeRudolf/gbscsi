Refer to the ordering guide first

You can replace the 50 Pin SCSI connector with JLC/LCSC part number C713793 for fancier eject levers

If you need jumpers for termination, include 2x C168674 in the BoM - though honestly, that's not a great
 price for jumpers. No idea if JLC would be smart enough to stab them on the headers.

For the microcontroller, you can use either part number C526178 or C8734. 8734 is the original part and
a bit more expensive, 526178 is cheaper but incurs a $2 setup fee. It mostly depends on which one is in stock.
Just edit the BoM spreadsheet to change that and you're all set. If anything else is out of stock, browsing thru
jlcpcb.com/parts will let you pick alternates and plug into the BoM as replacements using these same instructions.
