From parts unknown... A Cheap SCSI Disk Emulator board

This thing is poorly documented. Everything in this repo was, if still somewhat carefully, hastily done.
It's free. Do whatever the hell you want with it. Just keep attribution.
Unfortunately the actual design files are in proprietary format, but I may redo it in KiCad someday.
If that ever happens, I'll push it here.

Included is a somewhat workable STEP file you can use for modeling an enclosure

Everything else is pretty self-explanatory. You don't need too big a grasp of electronics to use the contents, just
a willingness to learn - some of the files provide guarantee most of the work is already done.

As usual, suggestions welcome.
